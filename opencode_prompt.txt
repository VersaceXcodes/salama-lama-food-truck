You are a senior UI/UX + frontend engineer. Fix the site’s TOP NAV BAR so it looks modern and is 100% mobile responsive.

Problem:
On mobile the header is broken: the logo is not centered/aligned, icons are cropped/half visible (cart), spacing is inconsistent, and the header overlaps content. See attached screenshot.

Goals:
1) Build a clean, modern mobile-first header that matches the existing brand (warm beige background + dark brown accents).
2) On mobile, use a simple 3-part layout:
   - Left: hamburger button
   - Center: logo (clickable -> Home)
   - Right: cart icon with badge + profile icon (or login)
3) Nothing should be cropped. Header must never overflow horizontally. No icon should be partially visible.
4) Responsive behavior:
   - Mobile: icons only, centered logo, consistent padding, tap targets large enough.
   - Tablet/Desktop: show full nav links (Menu, Catering, About, Contact, FAQs, Track Order) with logo + actions.
   - Smoothly switch between modes at a sensible breakpoint.
5) Sticky behavior:
   - Header stays fixed/sticky at top while scrolling.
   - Add proper spacing so page content is not hidden under the header.
6) Drawer menu:
   - Hamburger opens a real mobile drawer with nav links + login/signup + cart.
   - Drawer should scroll if content is tall, and close on link click.
7) Implementation constraints:
   - Do NOT hardcode “magic” pixel numbers everywhere. Prefer existing design tokens, Tailwind utility classes, or CSS variables.
   - Use flex/grid correctly (no absolute positioning for main layout).
   - Ensure safe-area support on iPhone (notch) and prevent body scroll when drawer is open.
8) Accessibility:
   - aria-labels on buttons, keyboard navigation, focus trap in drawer, ESC closes.
   - Cart badge announced properly.

What to do:
- Find the current header/nav component(s) (desktop + mobile) and refactor into ONE responsive component.
- Remove any duplicate headers rendering on mobile.
- Fix any containers causing clipping (overflow hidden, wrong widths).
- Ensure header uses full width, consistent padding, and aligns items using flexbox.

Deliverables:
- List files changed.
- Provide the updated component code.
- Provide any small CSS/Tailwind additions needed.
- Explain briefly what caused the cropping (e.g., overflow/width constraints/duplicate headers) and how you verified on iPhone-sized screens.

Acceptance tests:
- iPhone width: logo centered, hamburger left, cart+profile right, badge fully visible, no overlap with content.
- Scrolling: header stays in place, content starts below it.
- Drawer opens with links visible (not blank) and closes properly.

When the user mentions generic pages, map them to concrete files/components by scanning for headings and routes. Examples you MUST follow:
- If the user says "login" or "sign in", search for components containing the literal heading "Sign in to your account" and edit that file.
- If the user says "sign up" or "register", search for "Create your account" or equivalent.
- Always return an explicit list of changed file paths. If your first attempt doesn't change the UI, re-search by heading text and update the correct file.

⚠️ PRIORITY INSTRUCTIONS:
- The user's request above is the PRIMARY task. Complete it first.
- Ignore any existing errors, warnings, or issues you detect in the project unless they directly prevent you from completing the user's requested task.
- Do NOT automatically fix unrelated errors or refactor code unless explicitly requested.
- Focus solely on implementing the user's request: "You are a senior UI/UX + frontend engineer. Fix the site’s TOP NAV BAR so it looks modern and is 100% mobile responsive.
