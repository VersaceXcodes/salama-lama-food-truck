Fix the image rendering issue on the customer-facing menu. Images uploaded via the Admin Dashboard are not displaying on the live website.

1. The Technical Task (Data Binding)

Connect Backend to Frontend: Ensure the Product Image field in the database is correctly mapped to the Image Source (src) on the frontend card component.

Check API Response: Verify that the API fetching the menu data includes the full image URL path (e.g., https://.../image.jpg) and not just a filename or null value.

Permissions: Ensure the storage bucket or media folder where admin images are saved has "Public Read" access so customers can actually see them.

2. The Frontend Implementation

Dynamic Rendering: On the menu list, change the static image placeholder to a dynamic variable (e.g., {item.image_url}).

Fallback State: If a product does not have an image uploaded in the admin panel yet, display a default "Salama Lama" logo placeholder instead of a broken link icon.

3. Admin Panel Improvement

Preview: Add a small thumbnail preview in the Admin "Edit Product" view so I can confirm the image uploaded successfully before I save.

When the user mentions generic pages, map them to concrete files/components by scanning for headings and routes. Examples you MUST follow:
- If the user says "login" or "sign in", search for components containing the literal heading "Sign in to your account" and edit that file.
- If the user says "sign up" or "register", search for "Create your account" or equivalent.
- Always return an explicit list of changed file paths. If your first attempt doesn't change the UI, re-search by heading text and update the correct file.

⚠️ PRIORITY INSTRUCTIONS:
- The user's request above is the PRIMARY task. Complete it first.
- Ignore any existing errors, warnings, or issues you detect in the project unless they directly prevent you from completing the user's requested task.
- Do NOT automatically fix unrelated errors or refactor code unless explicitly requested.
- Focus solely on implementing the user's request: "Fix the image rendering issue on the customer-facing menu. Images uploaded via the Admin Dashboard are not displaying on the live website.

- Only address errors if they block the specific functionality requested by the user.
