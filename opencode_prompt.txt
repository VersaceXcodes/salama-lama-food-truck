PHASE 2 — MENU PAGE UI ONLY (use MENU from Phase 1)

Goal: Update only the Menu page UI to match the Just Eat-style layout shown:
- Search bar at top
- Sticky horizontal category pills
- First section is “Highlights” as a horizontal row of 4 compact cards
- Then normal sections in order with “X items” on the right of each header
- Cards in a 2-column grid on desktop, 1 column on mobile
- Each card shows name, € price, 2–3 line description (ellipsis), optional right thumbnail, and a circular “+” button top-right
- An “i” info icon next to the item name

Implementation details:
1) Top search
- Input placeholder: “Search in Salama Lama”
- Filters items by name + desc (case-insensitive)
- Keep categories visible; if a category has no matches, show a small “No matching items” line inside that section.

2) Sticky pills
- Pills: Highlights, Most Popular, Grilled Subs, Saj Wraps, Loaded Fries, Rice Bowls, Sides, Sauces and Dips, Drinks
- Smooth scroll to sections
- Active pill updates while scrolling (IntersectionObserver)

3) Highlights row
- Horizontal scroll row on mobile, 4 compact cards
- Each highlight card shows a small label (its category title), name, price, and a circular “+” button.
- If image exists for chicken grilled sub, show thumbnail; otherwise leave text-only.

4) Section headers
- Show section title left + “X items” right based on filtered results.
- Show category note lines for:
  Grilled Subs: “All grilled subs are served with signature topped fries.”
  Saj Wraps: “All saj wraps are served with signature topped fries.”
  Rice Bowls: “Rice bowls are topped with signature topped fries.”

5) Card interactions (placeholder for Phase 3)
- Clicking card or “+” should open a basic modal with item name + price + fullDesc (no modifiers yet), and a single “Add” button that just adds 1 item to a temporary cart array in memory (or shows a toast). Cart drawer and full checkout come in Phase 3.

Do not touch backend payments/integrations in this phase.
END PHASE 2

When the user mentions generic pages, map them to concrete files/components by scanning for headings and routes. Examples you MUST follow:
- If the user says "login" or "sign in", search for components containing the literal heading "Sign in to your account" and edit that file.
- If the user says "sign up" or "register", search for "Create your account" or equivalent.
- Always return an explicit list of changed file paths. If your first attempt doesn't change the UI, re-search by heading text and update the correct file.

⚠️ PRIORITY INSTRUCTIONS:
- The user's request above is the PRIMARY task. Complete it first.
- Ignore any existing errors, warnings, or issues you detect in the project unless they directly prevent you from completing the user's requested task.
- Do NOT automatically fix unrelated errors or refactor code unless explicitly requested.
- Focus solely on implementing the user's request: "PHASE 2 — MENU PAGE UI ONLY (use MENU from Phase 1)

- Only address errors if they block the specific functionality requested by the user.
