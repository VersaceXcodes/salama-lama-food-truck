Redesign the "Product Customization" interface for a food delivery website to match the UX of Just Eat or Uber Eats. The design must be responsive for both Desktop and Mobile.

1. Visual Style & Layout

Desktop View: Display as a centered Modal Pop-up (Lightbox) over the menu. Left column: Large high-quality food image. Right column: Scrollable customization options with a sticky "Add to Order" button at the bottom.

Mobile View: Display as a Full-Screen Bottom Sheet. Top third is the hero image. Below is the scrollable content. The "Add to Order" button must be a fixed sticky bar at the very bottom of the screen.

Typography: Clean sans-serif (Inter/Roboto). Bold headings for option groups (e.g., "Choose Your Protein").

2. Content Structure (Use this real data) Use the "Grilled Sub" item to populate the design:

Header: "Grilled Sub" (€14.50) + Description.

Section 1 (Required): "Choose Your Protein". Display as a Radio Button List.

Kick'n Chicken (Base)

Buss'n Brisket (+€1.50)

Section 2 (Required): "Spice Level". Display as Large Pill Toggles or Radio Buttons.

Mild

Spicy

Section 3 (Optional): "Remove Items". Display as Checkboxes.

No Cheese, No Garlic.

Section 4 (Upsell): "Make it a Meal". Display as Checkboxes with Thumbnail Images.

Add Halloumi Sticks (+€6.50).

3. Key UX Elements

Badges: Distinctly label sections as "Required" (in red/orange text) or "Optional" (in grey).

Validation: The primary button "Add to Order - €14.50" should look disabled/greyed out until the user selects a protein and spice level.

Colors: Background #FFFFFF, Text #333333, Buttons Dark Coffee Brown (#2C1A16).

When the user mentions generic pages, map them to concrete files/components by scanning for headings and routes. Examples you MUST follow:
- If the user says "login" or "sign in", search for components containing the literal heading "Sign in to your account" and edit that file.
- If the user says "sign up" or "register", search for "Create your account" or equivalent.
- Always return an explicit list of changed file paths. If your first attempt doesn't change the UI, re-search by heading text and update the correct file.

⚠️ PRIORITY INSTRUCTIONS:
- The user's request above is the PRIMARY task. Complete it first.
- Ignore any existing errors, warnings, or issues you detect in the project unless they directly prevent you from completing the user's requested task.
- Do NOT automatically fix unrelated errors or refactor code unless explicitly requested.
- Focus solely on implementing the user's request: "Redesign the "Product Customization" interface for a food delivery website to match the UX of Just Eat or Uber Eats. The design must be responsive for both Desktop and Mobile.
