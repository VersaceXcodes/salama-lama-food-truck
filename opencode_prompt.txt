Ensure the menu data matches the PDF and the Just Eat menu exactly.

Update the Admin Menu Management system so that:

Categories and items mirror the extracted menu structure.

Names, descriptions, and prices are mapped correctly.

Existing menu data is replaced with the new menu data.

Ensure the Customer Menu Page dynamically reflects the same updated menu from the admin panel (single shared data source).

Do not hardcode menu values.
Use dynamic data binding between Admin and Customer menu pages.

When the user mentions generic pages, map them to concrete files/components by scanning for headings and routes. Examples you MUST follow:
- If the user says "login" or "sign in", search for components containing the literal heading "Sign in to your account" and edit that file.
- If the user says "sign up" or "register", search for "Create your account" or equivalent.
- Always return an explicit list of changed file paths. If your first attempt doesn't change the UI, re-search by heading text and update the correct file.

⚠️ PRIORITY INSTRUCTIONS:
- The user's request above is the PRIMARY task. Complete it first.
- Ignore any existing errors, warnings, or issues you detect in the project unless they directly prevent you from completing the user's requested task.
- Do NOT automatically fix unrelated errors or refactor code unless explicitly requested.
- Focus solely on implementing the user's request: "Locate the file named Salama_Lama_Delivery_App_Menu_FULL_v2.pdf in the project directory.
