Redesign the mobile menu view to be high-density and compact, exactly like the Just Eat or Deliveroo mobile interface.

1. The List Layout (Crucial Fix):

Do NOT use large vertical cards.

Use a Compact List View: Each food item must be a short horizontal row (max height 110px).

Density Goal: Users must be able to see 3 to 4 full menu items on a single mobile screen.

Row Structure:

Left Side (70% width): Text content. Item Title (bold, size 16px), 2 lines of description (grey, size 12px), and Price (bold black, bottom left).

Right Side (30% width): A square thumbnail image (80x80px) with rounded corners.

Divider: A thin light-grey line separating each row.

2. Top Navigation (Highlights/Categories):

Position: Sticky top bar (stays visible when scrolling).

Style: Horizontal scrolling "Pill" buttons.

Visuals:

Inactive pills: White background, Grey border, Dark text.

Active/Selected pill: Dark Coffee Brown background (#2C1A16), White text.

Categories: "Highlights", "Meal Deals", "Wraps", "Subs", "Sides", "Drinks".

3. Floating Elements:

Remove any large floating buttons that cover the content.

Use a minimal "View Basket" sticky bar at the very bottom of the viewport (full width, dark brown background).

When the user mentions generic pages, map them to concrete files/components by scanning for headings and routes. Examples you MUST follow:
- If the user says "login" or "sign in", search for components containing the literal heading "Sign in to your account" and edit that file.
- If the user says "sign up" or "register", search for "Create your account" or equivalent.
- Always return an explicit list of changed file paths. If your first attempt doesn't change the UI, re-search by heading text and update the correct file.

⚠️ PRIORITY INSTRUCTIONS:
- The user's request above is the PRIMARY task. Complete it first.
- Ignore any existing errors, warnings, or issues you detect in the project unless they directly prevent you from completing the user's requested task.
- Do NOT automatically fix unrelated errors or refactor code unless explicitly requested.
- Focus solely on implementing the user's request: "Redesign the mobile menu view to be high-density and compact, exactly like the Just Eat or Deliveroo mobile interface.

- Only address errors if they block the specific functionality requested by the user.
