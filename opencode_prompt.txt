Add a Home item in the admin sidebar and improve the sidebar menu structure.

Requirements

Add “Home” to the very top of the admin sidebar (above Dashboard).

Icon: house

Route: navigate to the public website landing page / (NOT the admin dashboard).

On click, it should close the mobile sidebar (if open).

Reorder and standardize the sidebar items in this order (use existing routes if they exist; don’t break anything):

Home → /

Dashboard → existing route

Orders → existing route

Menu Items (or “Menu”) → existing route

Categories → create route if missing (admin page that lists/adds/edits/reorders categories used on the customer menu)

Stock → existing route

Delivery → existing route

Discounts → existing route

Customers → existing route

Staff / Roles → existing route (if “Staff” exists, keep it; if not, create)

Invoices → existing route

Analytics / Reports → existing route

Activity Logs → existing route

Settings → existing route

Mobile behavior

On screens under md:

Sidebar must be hidden by default.

A hamburger button in the admin top bar should open it.

Sidebar should slide in from the left.

Show a dark translucent overlay behind it.

User can close it by:

Tapping the overlay

Tapping a visible “X” close button at the top of the sidebar

Pressing ESC

When sidebar is open, prevent background scrolling.

Desktop behavior

On md and above:

Sidebar is fixed on the left, not overlaying the content.

Main content area should have correct left padding/margin so nothing is covered.

Implementation notes

Reuse the existing sidebar component and styles as much as possible.

Do not introduce a new UI library.

Make sure the active route is highlighted.

If you create a new Categories admin page/route, make it minimal but functional (list, add, edit name, delete, reorder optional).

Provide the exact files changed and the code changes.

Deliverable

Make the changes, ensure it compiles, and summarize what you changed.

When the user mentions generic pages, map them to concrete files/components by scanning for headings and routes. Examples you MUST follow:
- If the user says "login" or "sign in", search for components containing the literal heading "Sign in to your account" and edit that file.
- If the user says "sign up" or "register", search for "Create your account" or equivalent.
- Always return an explicit list of changed file paths. If your first attempt doesn't change the UI, re-search by heading text and update the correct file.

⚠️ PRIORITY INSTRUCTIONS:
- The user's request above is the PRIMARY task. Complete it first.
- Ignore any existing errors, warnings, or issues you detect in the project unless they directly prevent you from completing the user's requested task.
- Do NOT automatically fix unrelated errors or refactor code unless explicitly requested.
- Focus solely on implementing the user's request: "Add a Home item in the admin sidebar and improve the sidebar menu structure.

- Only address errors if they block the specific functionality requested by the user.
