Upgrade the Admin Dashboard "Product Image" functionality to support direct file uploads instead of manual URL entry.

1. Admin Panel Changes (The Upload)

Replace Input: Change the current "Image URL" text field to a File Upload Component (Drag & Drop or "Browse Computer").

File Support: Allow .jpg, .png, and .webp formats. Max file size: 5MB.

Preview: Immediately show a thumbnail preview of the selected image in the Admin form before saving.

2. Backend Logic (The Storage)

Action: When I click "Save Product," the system must:

Upload the physical file to a storage bucket (e.g., AWS S3, Firebase Storage, or Cloudinary).

Generate a Public Access URL for that file.

Save this new Public URL into the database image field for that product.

3. Frontend Sync (The Customer View)

Binding: Ensure the customer-facing menu component fetches the image field from the database.

Rendering: The code should look like: <img src={product.image_url} ... />

Cache Busting: Ensure that if I replace an image in the Admin panel, the customer view updates immediately (disable aggressive caching for product images).

When the user mentions generic pages, map them to concrete files/components by scanning for headings and routes. Examples you MUST follow:
- If the user says "login" or "sign in", search for components containing the literal heading "Sign in to your account" and edit that file.
- If the user says "sign up" or "register", search for "Create your account" or equivalent.
- Always return an explicit list of changed file paths. If your first attempt doesn't change the UI, re-search by heading text and update the correct file.

⚠️ PRIORITY INSTRUCTIONS:
- The user's request above is the PRIMARY task. Complete it first.
- Ignore any existing errors, warnings, or issues you detect in the project unless they directly prevent you from completing the user's requested task.
- Do NOT automatically fix unrelated errors or refactor code unless explicitly requested.
- Focus solely on implementing the user's request: "Upgrade the Admin Dashboard "Product Image" functionality to support direct file uploads instead of manual URL entry.

- Only address errors if they block the specific functionality requested by the user.
