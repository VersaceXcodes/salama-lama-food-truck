Clean white background with a sticky footer button.

Typography: Modern sans-serif (Inter or Roboto). Headings in Dark Charcoal, details in Grey.

Accent Color: Dark Coffee Brown (#2C1A16) for selected states and the primary action button.

Layout Structure:

Header: Product Title 'Grilled Sub' (Bold, Large) with Price '€14.50' next to it. Beneath, a short grey description: 'Toasted ciabatta sub filled with melted mozzarella...'.

Scrollable Content Area (The Modifiers): The list needs to be broken into distinct sections with clear headers.

Section B (Radio Button Group): Header 'Spice Level' with a '1 Required' badge. Options: Mild, Spicy (Harissa).

Footer (Sticky):

A quantity counter (- 1 +) on the left.

A large, full-width 'Add to Order - €14.50' button in Dark Coffee Brown on the right.

UX Details:

Use circular radio buttons for 'Select One' options.

Use square checkboxes for 'Select Multiple' options.

Grey out the 'Add to Order' button until all 'Required' fields are selected."

When the user mentions generic pages, map them to concrete files/components by scanning for headings and routes. Examples you MUST follow:
- If the user says "login" or "sign in", search for components containing the literal heading "Sign in to your account" and edit that file.
- If the user says "sign up" or "register", search for "Create your account" or equivalent.
- Always return an explicit list of changed file paths. If your first attempt doesn't change the UI, re-search by heading text and update the correct file.

⚠️ PRIORITY INSTRUCTIONS:
- The user's request above is the PRIMARY task. Complete it first.
- Ignore any existing errors, warnings, or issues you detect in the project unless they directly prevent you from completing the user's requested task.
- Do NOT automatically fix unrelated errors or refactor code unless explicitly requested.
- Focus solely on implementing the user's request: "UI/UX design of a food delivery product customization modal (pop-up) for a restaurant website, inspired by the Just Eat and Deliveroo interface.
