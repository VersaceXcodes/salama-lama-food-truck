I want to update the global top navigation/header across all pages so the left brand area shows my logo image (attached) instead of the text “Salama Lama”.

Requirements

Site-wide header change

Update the shared header/nav component used across the site (Landing, Menu, Checkout, Login/Signup, Dashboard, etc.).

Replace the text brand with the provided logo image.

The logo must link to / (home) when clicked.

Logo rendering rules

Use the uploaded logo file as the source (store it in /public or your project assets and reference it properly).

Keep transparency (PNG).

Add alt="Salama Lama" and ensure it’s accessible.

Use responsive sizing:

Mobile: height ~ 28–32px

Desktop: height ~ 36–44px

Width auto (maintain aspect ratio)

Prevent layout shift: set explicit height/width or use an optimized image component if available.

Mobile-friendly header behavior

On mobile:

Logo stays left

Nav links collapse into a hamburger menu

Cart icon + guest/user dropdown remain usable and do not overlap

Ensure the logo never gets squashed or pushes icons off-screen.

Spacing + alignment

Vertically center the logo with the header items.

Keep the same beige background and clean modern look.

Add a small safe padding left/right (px-4 mobile, px-6 tablet+).

Consistency

Ensure this logo header appears the same on every route/page (no page-specific header differences).

Remove any duplicate headers (avoid double nav bars).

Acceptance criteria

All pages show the logo in the header instead of “Salama Lama”.

Clicking the logo goes home.

On mobile, header remains clean: logo + icons visible, menu in hamburger, no wrapping/overlap.

Now implement this by:

Adding the logo asset to /public (or equivalent)

Updating the shared SiteHeader/AppHeader component to render the logo image

Confirming all page layouts use the same header component

When the user mentions generic pages, map them to concrete files/components by scanning for headings and routes. Examples you MUST follow:
- If the user says "login" or "sign in", search for components containing the literal heading "Sign in to your account" and edit that file.
- If the user says "sign up" or "register", search for "Create your account" or equivalent.
- Always return an explicit list of changed file paths. If your first attempt doesn't change the UI, re-search by heading text and update the correct file.

⚠️ PRIORITY INSTRUCTIONS:
- The user's request above is the PRIMARY task. Complete it first.
- Ignore any existing errors, warnings, or issues you detect in the project unless they directly prevent you from completing the user's requested task.
- Do NOT automatically fix unrelated errors or refactor code unless explicitly requested.
- Focus solely on implementing the user's request: "I want to update the global top navigation/header across all pages so the left brand area shows my logo image (attached) instead of the text “Salama Lama”.

- Only address errors if they block the specific functionality requested by the user.

Additional context:
User uploaded the following images. Place them exactly where requested; if no explicit location is provided, position them where they best fit within the layout without breaking responsiveness.
