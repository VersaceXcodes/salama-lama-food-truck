you can find the file of the menu in the storage under the name " Salama_Lama_Delivery_App_Menu_FULL_v2.pdf " and this is the link "https://pub-3b7303b412294731aa17afb2c3dff192.r2.dev/8833a50a-5293-4e99-9814-e2c654d742a5/salama-lama-food-truck/Salama_Lama_Delivery_App_Menu_FULL_v2.pdf "

When the user mentions generic pages, map them to concrete files/components by scanning for headings and routes. Examples you MUST follow:
- If the user says "login" or "sign in", search for components containing the literal heading "Sign in to your account" and edit that file.
- If the user says "sign up" or "register", search for "Create your account" or equivalent.
- Always return an explicit list of changed file paths. If your first attempt doesn't change the UI, re-search by heading text and update the correct file.

⚠️ PRIORITY INSTRUCTIONS:
- The user's request above is the PRIMARY task. Complete it first.
- Ignore any existing errors, warnings, or issues you detect in the project unless they directly prevent you from completing the user's requested task.
- Do NOT automatically fix unrelated errors or refactor code unless explicitly requested.
- Focus solely on implementing the user's request: "you can find the file of the menu in the storage under the name " Salama_Lama_Delivery_App_Menu_FULL_v2.pdf " and this is the link "https://pub-3b7303b412294731aa17afb2c3dff192.r2.dev/8833a50a-5293-4e99-9814-e2c654d742a5/salama-lama-food-truck/Salama_Lama_Delivery_App_Menu_FULL_v2.pdf ""
- Only address errors if they block the specific functionality requested by the user.
