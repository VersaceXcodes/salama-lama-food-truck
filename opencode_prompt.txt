the Customize & Add flow works on desktop, but on mobile (iPhone Safari/Chrome) the modal/bottom-sheet opens and appears mostly empty/blank (only the title + close icon show). The customization options (radio groups, add-ons, etc.) are not visible or are being rendered off-screen. Goal Make the Customize & Add modal 100% mobile responsive and always usable: On mobile, the customer must clearly see and select all required options. No content should be off-canvas horizontally. The modal must be scrollable for long option lists. Keep the same brand theme (cream background + dark brown accents). Do not hardcode pixel “magic numbers”. Use existing design tokens/variables, responsive utility classes, clamp(), %, vh/dvh, and existing breakpoint utilities (e.g., Tailwind sm/md), but avoid new random fixed px values. What to investigate (likely root causes) Layout stays “desktop two-column” on mobile (image/details column + options column) causing options to shift to the right and appear blank. Modal body/container has overflow: hidden or a fixed height that clips content. Inner content uses position: absolute / translate / large margins that push options off-screen. Conditional rendering: options only render under a “desktop” condition or hydration mismatch. Z-index/overlay stacking or container width constraints causing the options to render outside the visible area. Required UI behavior Mobile layout: modal becomes a bottom sheet or full-screen dialog: Header row: product name + close button. Then product image (optional) and product details. Then customization groups stacked one column. Sticky footer inside modal: total + “Add to Cart”. Desktop layout can remain two-column if you want, but must gracefully collapse to one column on mobile. The modal content area must use a single vertical scroll region (no weird nested scroll traps). Must handle iOS safe area (home indicator) so the sticky footer isn’t cut off. Implementation guidance (what to change) Find the component responsible (ex: CustomizeAddModal, ProductCustomizerModal, ItemOptionsDialog, etc.). Ensure modal container uses: width: 100% on mobile and does not exceed viewport width no horizontal overflow (overflow-x: hidden) modal body: overflow-y: auto with viewport-based max height (dvh/vh) and safe-area padding Replace any desktop grid-cols-2 / flex-row default with: mobile default: single column desktop breakpoint: two columns Ensure inner columns allow shrinking: min-width: 0 on flex/grid children so content doesn’t overflow. If using a dialog library (Radix/shadcn/ui/etc.), make sure it portals to document.body and isn’t clipped by a parent container that has overflow: hidden. If the options are fetched, confirm the modal doesn’t open before data is ready; show a skeleton/loading state (not a blank white page). Add an automated check: when a customizable item is opened on a narrow viewport, the options list must be visible and selectable. Acceptance criteria On iPhone-sized viewport: Opening Customize & Add shows product info + options immediately (no blank screen). Required options can be selected and validation messages are visible. The modal scrolls smoothly; footer CTA remains accessible. No horizontal scrolling is needed. On desktop: current layout still looks good. Deliverables Code changes to the modal component + styles (using existing tokens/utilities, no new random fixed px numbers). Brief explanation of the root cause you found and what you changed.

When the user mentions generic pages, map them to concrete files/components by scanning for headings and routes. Examples you MUST follow:
- If the user says "login" or "sign in", search for components containing the literal heading "Sign in to your account" and edit that file.
- If the user says "sign up" or "register", search for "Create your account" or equivalent.
- Always return an explicit list of changed file paths. If your first attempt doesn't change the UI, re-search by heading text and update the correct file.

⚠️ PRIORITY INSTRUCTIONS:
- The user's request above is the PRIMARY task. Complete it first.
- Ignore any existing errors, warnings, or issues you detect in the project unless they directly prevent you from completing the user's requested task.
- Do NOT automatically fix unrelated errors or refactor code unless explicitly requested.
- Focus solely on implementing the user's request: "the Customize & Add flow works on desktop, but on mobile (iPhone Safari/Chrome) the modal/bottom-sheet opens and appears mostly empty/blank (only the title + close icon show).
