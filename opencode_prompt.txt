High-fidelity UI design of a food delivery restaurant menu page, desktop view. The layout should be structurally identical to Just Eat or DoorDash.

Color Palette:

Primary Accent: Dark Coffee Brown (#2C1A16) - used for buttons and active states.

Background: Clean White (#FFFFFF) with subtle warm beige (#F9F5F0) section backgrounds.

Text: Dark Charcoal for headings, medium grey for descriptions.

Layout Structure (3-Column):

Left Column (Navigation): A sticky sidebar listing food categories (e.g., Grilled Subs, Saj Wraps, Rice Bowls). Active category highlighted in Dark Coffee Brown.

Center Column (Menu Feed): A vertical list of food items. Each item is a horizontal row with a clean separator line.

Content (Left): Food Title (Bold Sans-serif), 2-line description, and Price (€14.50).

Visual (Right): A high-quality square food image with rounded corners (12px radius).

Action: A minimal circular 'Plus' (+) button next to the price or image.

Right Column (Basket): A fixed, sticky 'Your Order' summary panel with a checkout button in Dark Coffee Brown.

Style: Minimalist, clean lines, high readability, modern sans-serif typography (Inter or Roboto).

When the user mentions generic pages, map them to concrete files/components by scanning for headings and routes. Examples you MUST follow:
- If the user says "login" or "sign in", search for components containing the literal heading "Sign in to your account" and edit that file.
- If the user says "sign up" or "register", search for "Create your account" or equivalent.
- Always return an explicit list of changed file paths. If your first attempt doesn't change the UI, re-search by heading text and update the correct file.

⚠️ PRIORITY INSTRUCTIONS:
- The user's request above is the PRIMARY task. Complete it first.
- Ignore any existing errors, warnings, or issues you detect in the project unless they directly prevent you from completing the user's requested task.
- Do NOT automatically fix unrelated errors or refactor code unless explicitly requested.
- Focus solely on implementing the user's request: "High-fidelity UI design of a food delivery restaurant menu page, desktop view. The layout should be structurally identical to Just Eat or DoorDash.
