FIX: Item customization options are not selectable in the menu item modal.
Right now the modal only shows a banner “Customization options available…” but no controls. Implement modifier groups UI + cart pricing so customers can choose spice level, add-ons, and extras.

SCOPE
- Only change menu customization behavior + modal UI + cart line item structure (do NOT redesign the whole menu page).
- Must work for items in these categories (or item types): Grilled Subs, Saj Wraps, Loaded Fries, Rice Bowls.
- If “Most Popular” reuses those same items, the modifiers must still appear (don’t treat Most Popular as a separate non-customizable category).

STEP 1 — Ensure the DATA MODEL supports modifiers (if missing, add it)
Each menu item must support:
- modifiers: array of modifierGroups
Each modifierGroup:
- id, title, required (bool), minSelect, maxSelect
- type: "single" (radio) or "multi" (checkbox) or "single_optional" (select / radio with “None”)
- options: [{ id, label, priceDelta }]

If current menu data does not include modifiers, then add modifiers dynamically based on the item’s base category:
- If category in [grilled-subs, saj-wraps, loaded-fries, rice-bowls], attach modifierGroups below.

Modifier Groups to implement:

A) Spice Level (REQUIRED)
- title: “Spice Level”
- required: true, minSelect: 1, maxSelect: 1, type: single
- options:
  - Mild (+€0.00)
  - Spicy (+€0.00) (note text: “Harissa instead of hot honey”)

B) Remove Items (OPTIONAL, free) — multi checkbox
- required: false, minSelect: 0, maxSelect: depends on list, type: multi
- grilled-subs: No cheese, No garlic, No salad (fries only), No hot honey
- saj-wraps: No cheese, No garlic, No salad (fries only), No hot honey
- loaded-fries: No cheese, No garlic, No salad, No hot honey
- rice-bowls: No cheese, No garlic, No salad, No hot honey, No fries on top
(All priceDelta €0.00)

C) Add-ons (OPTIONAL, paid) — multi checkbox
- required: false, minSelect: 0, type: multi
- grilled-subs:
  - Chicken topping on fries (+€3.00)
  - Brisket topping on fries (+€4.00)
  - Mixed topping on fries (+€5.00)
- saj-wraps:
  - Extra shredded mozzarella in wrap (+€1.00)
  - Chicken topping on fries (+€3.00)
  - Brisket topping on fries (+€4.00)
  - Mixed topping on fries (+€5.00)
- loaded-fries:
  - Extra chicken (+€3.99)
  - Extra brisket (+€4.99)
  - Extra mixed (+€5.99)
- rice-bowls:
  - Extra chicken (+€3.99)
  - Extra brisket (+€4.99)
  - Extra mixed (+€5.99)

D) Extras (OPTIONAL, paid) — multi checkbox
- required: false, minSelect: 0, type: multi
- Grilled Halloumi Sticks (+€6.50)
- Cheesy Pizza Poppers (+€6.50)

E) Add a Drink (OPTIONAL, choose max 1) — single_optional
- required: false, minSelect: 0, maxSelect: 1, type: single_optional
- options are the 10 drinks in the Drinks category (each option uses its drink price as priceDelta)
- include a “None” default option with +€0.00

STEP 2 — Render the modifier groups inside the MODAL
In the item modal:
- Replace the “Customization options available…” banner-only behavior with actual controls.
- Render modifier groups in this order:
  1) Required groups first (Spice Level)
  2) Optional groups after (Remove Items, Add-ons, Extras, Add a Drink)
This ordering should be consistent with common online ordering behavior where required modifiers appear first. 

Controls:
- Spice Level -> radio group
- Remove Items / Add-ons / Extras -> checkbox list, show “+€X.XX” for paid options
- Add a Drink -> radio group or dropdown with “None” option

Validation:
- Disable “Add to Cart” until all required modifier groups satisfy minSelect.
- If user tries to add without selecting required options, show inline error under that group.

Live price updates:
- The button text should update in real time:
  “Add to Cart • €{computedTotal}”
- computedTotal = basePrice + sum(priceDelta of all selected options)

STEP 3 — Cart line items must store selections + computed pricing
When adding to cart, store:
- itemId, name, basePrice
- selectedModifiers: [{ groupId, groupTitle, selections: [{ optionId, label, priceDelta }] }]
- quantity
- unitTotal (computedTotal at time of add)
- lineTotal = unitTotal * quantity

Cart display:
- Show item name
- Under it, show selected options in readable lines (e.g., “Spice Level: Spicy”, “Add-ons: Extra chicken”)
- Show unit total and line total
- Allow edit: reopening modal should prefill previous selections and recompute totals.

STEP 4 — Acceptance tests (must pass)
1) Open Brisket Saj Wrap modal -> Spice Level radios appear and are required.
2) Add-ons + Extras checkboxes appear and change total price instantly.
3) “Add a Drink” allows None or exactly 1 drink; selecting a drink adds its price.
4) Add to cart stores selections and shows them in cart.
5) Items outside these categories (Sides, Sauces and Dips, Drinks) do NOT show modifier UI.
END.

When the user mentions generic pages, map them to concrete files/components by scanning for headings and routes. Examples you MUST follow:
- If the user says "login" or "sign in", search for components containing the literal heading "Sign in to your account" and edit that file.
- If the user says "sign up" or "register", search for "Create your account" or equivalent.
- Always return an explicit list of changed file paths. If your first attempt doesn't change the UI, re-search by heading text and update the correct file.

⚠️ PRIORITY INSTRUCTIONS:
- The user's request above is the PRIMARY task. Complete it first.
- Ignore any existing errors, warnings, or issues you detect in the project unless they directly prevent you from completing the user's requested task.
- Do NOT automatically fix unrelated errors or refactor code unless explicitly requested.
- Focus solely on implementing the user's request: "FIX: Item customization options are not selectable in the menu item modal.
