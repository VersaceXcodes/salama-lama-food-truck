I am looking at the mobile view and it is broken. The product cards are overflowingOptimizationy (cut off on the right), images are too large, and the layout isn't responsive. Please R;.RITE the CSS for the entire application with these strict Mobile-First rules. Do not patch the existing code; replace the grid logic for mobile screens (max-width: 768px). 1. Fix the 'Overflow' (Horizontal Scrolling Issue) Apply overflow-x: hidden; to the body and html tags. Ensure the main container has width: 100% and padding: 0 16px; (16px safe zone on left/right) so text never touches the edge of the screen. 2. The Menu Grid (Vertical Stack RuOptimizationBug: The product cards are displaying side-by-side or in a horizontal slider. The Fix: On mobile, force the Product Grid to use display: grid; grid-template-columns: 1fr;. Result: This must stack the items vertically (one on top of the other). One item per row. Card Width: Set product cards to width: 100% !important; so they fit the screen perfectly. 3. Product Card Styling (Mobile Optimization) Image Aspect Ratio: Set product images to width: 100%; height: 200px; object-fit: cover;. This prevents them from being massive vertically. Text: Ensure the product title is font-size: 1.25rem and the description is truncated to 2 lines to save space. Buttons: Make the 'Add to Order' button Full Width and 48px height for easy tapping. 4. The Header & Navigation Height: Increase the mobile navbar height to 60px. Logo: Center the logo absolutely. Set height: 40px; width: auto;. Icons: Make the Hamburger Menu (left) and Cart Icon (right) larger (font-size: 24px or 24px width) and ensure they are 16px away from the screen edges. 5. Global Text Sizing Downscale all H1 headings on mobile to 2.2rem so they don't break onto three lines (like 'Where Flavour Meets Passion')."

When the user mentions generic pages, map them to concrete files/components by scanning for headings and routes. Examples you MUST follow:
- If the user says "login" or "sign in", search for components containing the literal heading "Sign in to your account" and edit that file.
- If the user says "sign up" or "register", search for "Create your account" or equivalent.
- Always return an explicit list of changed file paths. If your first attempt doesn't change the UI, re-search by heading text and update the correct file.

⚠️ PRIORITY INSTRUCTIONS:
- The user's request above is the PRIMARY task. Complete it first.
- Ignore any existing errors, warnings, or issues you detect in the project unless they directly prevent you from completing the user's requested task.
- Do NOT automatically fix unrelated errors or refactor code unless explicitly requested.
- Focus solely on implementing the user's request: "I am looking at the mobile view and it is broken.
